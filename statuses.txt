I put my soul in everything and still doin' it even if I don't have one anymore.
My life is just a wand with no magic, just classic.
Painful happiness that's all i feel, tryin' to keep it real.
I always took wrong direction just to achieve perfection.
Monsters keep gettin' created, but heroes will never be defeated.
